intro = """This demo showcases a simple yet powerful tool for classifying police reports using machine learning and natural language processing.\n
Despite being a very basic model trained on just 40 data points without any advanced text pre-processing techniques and model fine-tuning, 
it still achieves impressive classification results. Imagine the potential this tool when fully optimized 
and trained on more extensive data. Machine learning can streamline the process of a diverse classification tasks, saving 
valuable time and resources. Itâ€™s designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it an invaluable asset for police departments and other industries."""
